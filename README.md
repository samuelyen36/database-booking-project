# outline
This is the assignment of the course, introduction to database system, in National Chiao Tung University. The website of this project is https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~yenst/login.php 

# how to run
You can regist a new account to explore the function of this website.
I have to handle both front-end and back-end simultaneously with limited time, so I can barely focus on front-end of this website, I'm pretty sorry about that.

# note
I barely handle the case of injection. However, I can still handle them in our database system. Please do not bother me with that. :)
